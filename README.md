## Description

I was motivated to create a text editor because it is a useful tool for developers, like myself, to take quick, detailed notes.

## Installation

To install this project, you will need to clone the repository onto your local machine. Once done, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. To do this, navigate to the root directory of the project in your command terminal and run the following commands: 'npm i' and 'npm run start'. This will install the necessary dependencies and start your local server.

Navigate to your localhost port in your browser to use the app.

## Usage and Testing

To use Vending Machine, type out an important note and the page will save any changes you make.

You can also download the application to your computer and use it offline.

If you don't want to install but still want to use the app, follow the link below.

Future updates will include a better UI.
